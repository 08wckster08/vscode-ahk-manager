# vscode-ahk-manager README

Welcome to my third Extension !

Based on the [Sublime plug-In](https://github.com/ahkscript/SublimeAutoHotkey),
its the Yin of the [AutoHotkey extension](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-autohotkey).

I like to write AutoHotkey scripts, this language is amazing, but I often found myself go back and forth between writing an app, looking for it in my messy tray, reloading it, testing it, grab the browser and tuning it again. So I decided to improve my tools and add the capabiliy to just reload a script through a command and/or a button.

## Features

With this extension you can cut off the development time using easy and handy commands.
For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

* The almighty vs-code
* The powerful [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
* A deep understanding of the marvellous things you could do with the ahk language
* [AutoHotkey extension](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-autohotkey)... yeah it's not a requirement: it's a must ! ðŸ˜‰

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

> Note: maybe you'll have to set the `mainDirectoryPath` in order to make this extension working with AHK.

## Known Issues

* Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
* Icons aren't great (you could hide buttons if you don't like them, you'll still able to invoke commands through the command palette)

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.
