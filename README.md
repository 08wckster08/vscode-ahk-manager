# AutoHotkey Manager

**Welcome** to my third [Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Denis-net.vscode-ahk-manager) !

> WARNING : This extension could cause serious addictions !!! ðŸ˜œ

![manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Denis-net/vscode-ahk-manager/master/media/vs-ahk-manager.gif)

Inspired by the [Sublime plug-In](https://github.com/ahkscript/SublimeAutoHotkey),
this is the Yin of the [AutoHotkey extension](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-autohotkey) !

## Why

_I like to write AutoHotkey scripts, this language is amazing, but I often found myself go back and forth between writing an app, looking for it in my messy tray, reloading it, testing it, grab the browser and tuning it again. So I decided to improve my tools and add the capabiliy to just reload a script through a command and/or a button._

## Features

This extension manages for every script Meta-data, that will persist among vscode startups :

| Metadata             | Default value  | Command               |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Compiled Destination | scriptname.exe | `ahk.compile`         |
| Script Arguments     | n/d            | `ahk.set-script-args` |
| Icon Path            | scriptname.ico | `ahk.set-icon`        |
| Tray Icon Path       | n/d            | `ahk.set-tray-icon`   |

With this extension you can cut off the development time using handy commands:

* **Run** the script without compile it
  * Set command line arguments for scripts, with ("`Ctrl`+`A` `Ctrl`+`G`") (they will be remembered among startups)

* **Compile** in the script's folder by default
  * Change compile destination on the fly with **Compile As** (it will be remembered among startups)
![manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Denis-net/vscode-ahk-manager/master/media/vs-ahk-manager-compile-as.gif)
  * **Run Compiled** scripts
* **Kill** the script and the compiled exe with ease
* Tired of typing ? use buttons instead ! ðŸ˜‰
* Just want to test simple script parts ? select some text and **Run Buffered**
* If you put an icon with the same name of the `script.ahk` (so named `script.ico`) the icon will be used by the compiler.
  * Otherwise with the command `ahk.set-icon` an icon will be picked up instead of the default
* Using "`Ctrl`+`A` `Ctrl`+`D`" you can consult the docs
  * if you have a selection you will be automatically redirect on google.
* You can launch the ahk spy window with "`Ctrl`+`A` `Ctrl`+`S`"
* Chose an icon with "`Ctrl`+`A` `Ctrl+I`"
* Insert a tray icon with "`Ctrl`+`A` `Ctrl+T`"
  * subsequent call will update the TrayIcon value

* You can temporary switch executable on the fly with the `ahk.temporary-switch-executable` command
* Initialize an empty ahk script with the default snippet
  * Or define another one.
* [Experimental] an experimental formatter has been added so you could format a little bit the code (it use this [simple ahk script](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/55766-script-auto-formatter-very-basic-beginner-script/))
* With `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`A` grab the script manager viewer and check ahk scripts' states

![manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Denis-net/vscode-ahk-manager/master/media/vs-ahk-manager-manager.gif)
  * You can also interact with them :
    * Pause/Unpause
    * Suspend/Unsuspend
    * Kill
    * Click on name for reveal it in explorer
    * Click on (holding `Ctrl`) for open the containing folder in a new VSCode instance

## Requirements

* The almighty [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* The powerful [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
* A deep understanding of the marvellous things you could do with the ahk language
* [AutoHotkey extension](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-autohotkey)... yeah it's not a requirement: it's a must ! ðŸ˜‰
  * [AutoHotkey Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-autohotkey-plus) have an intresting formatter
    * You can disable mine through *`ahk.format` = false*

## Extension Settings

![manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Denis-net/vscode-ahk-manager/master/media/vs-ahk-manager-settings.gif)

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `ahk.onSearch.targetBrowser`: choose the right browser for performing your searches.
  * see [open](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open) for the right syntax (this is the **option** object)
* `ahk.onSearch.queryTemplate`: *with better question you'll get better answers*.
* `ahk.onSave.compile` and `ahk.onSave.run` could be helpfull
  * `ahk.onArgs.run` allow script to run as soon as you specify cmd line arguments (`Ctrl`+`A` `Ctrl`+`G`)
* `ahk.onEmpty.overrideHeaderSnippet` to override the snippet used for initializing empty ahk files
* `ahk.scriptFolders.openInNewInstance` specify, when `Ctrl`+`Clic` on a treeItem, the behaviour to open the script/exe's folder in VSCode
* `ahk.format.enabled` for disabling the formatter

> Note: maybe you'll have to set the `executableFullPath` setting in order to make this extension working with AHK.

## Known Issues

* Icons aren't great (you could hide buttons if you don't like them, you'll still be able to invoke commands through the command palette)
* Side effect of the Shortcuts starting with `Ctrl`+`A` : the _select all_ don't get triggered, so I added this workaround : `Ctrl+A Ctrl+A` for selecting all text in .ahk files ... could still be awkward... you could think about better shorcut combinations and adjust them manually for getting the `Ctrl+A` working normally again.

## Further Updates

* [ ] debugger
* [ ] improve icons and images
* [ ] improve code
  * [ ] comments
* [ ] formatter ?
* [ ] remember launched scripts from history so you could also launch them from an ahk.manager secondary treeview (like extension treeviews)
* [ ] better [offline docs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30844427/calling-html-help-from-command-prompt-with-keyword)

## Release Notes

### 0.0.4

* BugFix: `ahk.kill` command may kill itself before killing other scripts...
* Added `ahk.onSearch.OpenDocsAlwaysOffline`
* Improved the `ahk.run-buffer` command UI experience
* `ahk.run`,`ahk.compile` and `ahk.run-buffer` will save dirty script before operations
* Found an intresting way of showing the offline docs

### 0.0.3

Improved the `ahk.kill` command: now it affects run-piped scripts too.
(Thanks to [bugrobot](https://github.com/bugrobot) for having pointed this out to me).

### 0.0.2

Initial release of this extension.

> This is just a preview, but I think that is good enough to be considered usable.

May you **Enjoy** with this extension and craft amazing scripts with it !
